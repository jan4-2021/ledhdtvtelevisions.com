			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LED High Definition Television was designed to provide consumers with better quality and higher resolution than standard television systems. High definition television is perhaps most well known for there high quality of audio and visual, resembling the quality you would receive at a theatre. However, even if you possess a high definition television you will still need a high definition signal which can be obtained several different ways. Many people choose to pick up their high definition signal through using an antenna. Many of the recent designs in high definition televisions have this antenna built into the television. Cable companies oftentimes offer high definition television broadcasts as part of their services. You can also obtain high definition television signal and service through a satellite based television company. Examples of these companies are DirecTV and Dish Network. Components of a satellite LED television system are a standard satellite dish, high definition satellite receiver, high definition television monitor, and HDMI cable or DVI-D audio cables.</p>
<p>There are three main characteristics to an LED television broadcast system. The first of these identifiable parameters is the frame size. Frame size is referred to in pixels, like a digital camera. Frame size is referred to as how many horizontal pixels versus how many vertical pixels. You may see the formula for pixels looking like this: 1280 x 720. The second identifiable parameter is the scanning system which is defined as the letter p in italics or the letter i in italics. âPâ stands for progressive which would encompass LDTV and EDTV and displays 1,080 lines of resolution simultaneously. âIâ stands for Interlaced in which there are 1,080 lines of resolution and they are divided into pairs and encompasses SDTV. Frame rate is the third identifiable parameter for characteristics of a high definition broadcast system. Frame rate defines the number of video frames that flash by per second. High definition television requires less bandwidth than standard definition television due to the digital video compression built in.</p>
<p>A variation of high definition television is EDTV which stands for âenhanced definition televisionâ. Enhanced definition television describes the variation of a progressive version of the high definition television video format. High definition television has twice the linear resolution of any standard definition television. Since high definition television possesses twice the linear resolution this shows greater detail than any other system.</p>
<p>When looking for a high definition television to purchase you will need to know that the optimum format for a broadcast is dependent upon the video graphic recording medium that is used as well as the images characteristics. Also, the source and resolution should match the field and frame rate. Numerous companies manufacture LED high definition televisions such as Samsung, LG Electronics, Sony and Toshiba. Once you have determined which manufacturer you want to purchase an LED television from you will need to familiarize yourself with some terms and options to make your purchase simpler. There are a few different display types; LCD and LCD w/ LED. There are also different diagonal screen size options such as 40 inches to 49 inches and 50 inches or larger. Once you have decided on these choices you will need to familiarize yourself with aspect ratio and display format. You will also be able to choose which display refresh rate you want to invest in. Display refresh rates can be either 120 Hz or 240 Hz. You will of course have to choose which resolution and input you want as well. The input choices will depend upon what you will be using your LED television for. The input options are HDMI, Component video, VGA and S-Video.</p>
<p>Consumers who have switched to LED high definition television say they will never switch back to standard definition television. The advanced connectivity and picture performance as well as the eco-friendly aspects to LED high definition television are superb. Additionally, you can obtain an LED television with picture quality that has mega contrast and delivers deep, rich blacks and crisp, clean whites.</p>
<p>Overall, LED high definition television has been designed to provide the highest quality and best resolution visual and audio experience. You can grab some popcorn and sit in the comfort of your own home while enjoying all the visual and audio perks of a theatre.</p>
