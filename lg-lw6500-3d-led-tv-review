<p><a title="LG" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110520214848/http://ledhdtvtelevisions.com/lg-tv-42/">LG</a> and Samsung are arch rivals in <a title="LED TV" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110520214848/http://ledhdtvtelevisions.com/category/ledtv/">LED TV</a> and <a title="3D TV" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110520214848/http://ledhdtvtelevisions.com/category/3d-tv/">3D TV</a> production. Samsung currently leads the race in terms of sales figures but LG 3D LED TV fast gaining popularity and recognition, and if we take a look at LG LW6500 3D LED TV it is easy to see why.</p>
<p>This particular 55 inch 3D TV implements all the features you would expect of a top of the range home entertainment system and at a considerably more affordable cost. It is the usage of what LG has termed a ‘film type pattern retarder’ rather than the more costly glass substrate filter that has enabled LG to produce a more affordable 3D solution.</p>
<p>Ok so we’ve established that this passive 3D TV is competitively priced, but just as significantly you should know that it includes seven pairs of 3D polarising glasses. Take into consideration that of LG’s rivals, Samsung 3D TVs come with two free pairs and some Panasonic models don’t come with any. This is means big savings when you consider that the price for a pair of 3D active shutter glasses for a Samsung 3D TV range from $75 to $150. This is great selling point for LG and their FPR passive 3D TV in comparison to its active 3D TV competitors, a point which will play a big part in its success.</p>
<p>In practical term the first thing that you notice when viewing the LG LW6500 in 3D is easier on the eye to view. Anyone who has watched an active shutter 3D TV will know that it does cause the eyes to become tired after long periods of viewing. That’s not the case the LG LW6500 passive 3D TV.</p>
<p>The quality and effectiveness of the 3D images on display are on the whole good. If you sit too close to the TV there can be some negative effects, including poor definition to the edges of objects on display as well as horizontal lines. The resolutions are good, but perhaps not as good as some of its competitors. There are problems with poorly defined images due to crosstalk, but this is not a big problem that is limited to the LG FPR system, this is a problem which is frequently worse with other active 3D TV systems. One thing that has to be said is that the optimal 3D effect can only be achieved from the optimal viewing position, which is directly in front of the screen with the center of the screen at head height. The wider the viewing angle, the lesser the 3D effects become. Having said all this, the results when seated correctly are entertaining and quite impressive for the casual home viewer.</p>
<p>Still on the subject of picture quality, the LG LW6500 is on the whole good. It has an impressive 200 Hz refresh rate and a contrast ratio of 9000000:1. As you would expect from an LED TV the color gamut is good, producing realistically natural pictures. High definition images are impressive and sharp and motion is smooth.</p>
<p>Where the LG6500 falls short is with the backlighting system. With the local dimming feature enabled there is noticeable negative effect with bright areas bleeding into adjacent dark areas. Also there is some lag caused by the imaging gadgetry of this TV, which is a problem for gamers who play games that have fast paced action. However the ‘game mode’ helps to reduce this.</p>
<p>Connectivity options are plentiful with the model. As well as all the standard connection for hooking up your TV to your other home cinema devices, the TV is well equipped to connect to your homes <a title="computers" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110520214848/http://ledhdtvtelevisions.com/category/computer-laptop-pc/">computers</a>. There are a couple of USB ports for connecting to your other digital media stored on memory sticks and cameras. There is also and LAN port and optional wireless adaptor for connecting to PCs around the home. The implementation of this using PLEX system is slick and performs well.</p>
<p>The network connections also allow you to hook up the TV to the internet using LG Smart TV features. Internet is provided in the form of Smart TV Apps of which there is now a quite expansive range (some of which are quite diverse). As a whole the internet capabilities are well implemented in a clear and easily utilized manner.</p>
<p>In summary the LG LW65000 3D LED TV has to get a thumbs up for its great value in providing 3D viewing, a factor which will most like define its success. On the negative side it a shame that the backlighting underperforms.</p>
