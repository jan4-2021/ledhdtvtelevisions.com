<p>If you are looking to buy a new TV you will be faced with the choice of whether to go down the <a title="3D TV" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606125601/http://ledhdtvtelevisions.com/category/3d-tv/">3D TV</a> path or not. If so you will no doubt want to know what are the best 3D TV 2011 buying options so that you can make an informed choice on how to best spend you budget, this guide should help you make that choice.</p>
<p>The TV and entertainment industry is now committed to 3D technology so there is no reason to decide against buying a 3D TV because perhaps you are un convinced about the future of 3DTV. You can be sure that 3D TV is here to stay, with the expected percentage of 3D TV compatible TVs to make up 40% of all TVs sold over the next few years. Also with all 3D TVs being capable of displaying conventional 2D images, even if you don’t foresee yourself using the 3D capabilities too much, then the only reason to not buying one would be the extra cost associated with buying a 3D TV. Look at it another way, even if you don’t find 3D TV a big advantage at the moment, perhaps you will in a year or two because there are many new 3D TV services in the pipeline that might be of interest to you in the near future. Do you really want to risk having to go out replace a non 3D compatible TV in a couple of years time when you could of bought a TV that is both 2D and 3D compatible now?</p>
<p>If the extra expenditure is not an issue to you then do the wise thing and make sure that the next TV you buy is 3D capable. The whole argument might be somewhat irrelevant anyway because if you are looking at buying a mid to high range TV then most of the options in this category will be 3D TVs anyway.</p>
<p>What are your options? Your first choice is going to be between passive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606125601/http://ledhdtvtelevisions.com/active-3d-tv-vs-passive-3d-tv-review/">3D TV versus active 3D TV</a>. Technically both have their pros and cons, so arguments can be made in favour of the qualities of either. Where they differ is price, passive 3D TVs are cheaper and currently LG are the only manufacturer pushing this technology. Opting for passive 3D TV and you are currently in effect opting to buy an LG 3D TV. As an illustration of this – an LG 55 inch passive 3D <a title="LED TV" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606125601/http://ledhdtvtelevisions.com/category/ledtv/">LED TV</a> is almost $1000 cheaper than the equivalent top of the range Samsung 55 inch active 3D LED TV, and this is even before you take in to consideration the price of buying the active shutter glasses that go with the Samsung TV, they cost $70-$150 for a pair of active shutter 3D glasses. The Samsung 3D TV includes two pairs with the TV, where as the LG 3D TV includes four pairs (and additional pairs only cost approx $10).</p>
<p><strong>Passive 3D TV</strong><br/>
Pros<br/>
•    Cheaper total cost of ownership.<br/>
•    Brighter images.<br/>
•    Better frame rates, and motion handling.<br/>
•    Lighter 3D glasses.</p>
<p>Cons<br/>
•    Lower effective resolution.<br/>
•    Narrow vertical viewing angle.</p>
<p><strong>Active 3D TV</strong><br/>
Pros<br/>
•    True Full HD 3D TV, no reduction in resolution.</p>
<p>Cons<br/>
•    More prone to poor motion handling.<br/>
•    Prone to 3D crosstalk when glasses get out of sync.<br/>
•    More expensive cost of ownership.<br/>
•    3D glasses are expensive.<br/>
•    3D glasses can be uncomfortable.<br/>
•    3D glasses reduce the brightness of the TV.</p>
<p>So what are the contenders for the title of the best 3D TV? For me there are only 3 options Take a look at the options for best 3D TV 2011 and a summary of their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606125601/http://ledhdtvtelevisions.com/lg-lw6500-3d-led-tv-review/"></a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606125601/http://ledhdtvtelevisions.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LG-55LW6500-Best-3D-TV.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-3431" title="LG 55LW6500 Best 3D TV" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606125601im_/http://ledhdtvtelevisions.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/LG-55LW6500-Best-3D-TV.jpg" alt="LG 55LW6500 LED 3D TV" width="250" height="225"/></a>LG 55LW6500 55 inch Passive 3D TV</strong> – RRP $2700</p>
<p>Pros<br/>
•    Price is $1000 less than rivals (inc 3D glasses in this equation).<br/>
•    Passive 3D is easier to view than active TV. Both in terms of how comfortable the 3D glasses are, and lack of flicker associated with active shutter 2D glasses, many reviews and viewers have reported that less eye fatigue is experienced with passive TV.<br/>
•    Less negative 3D effects than with active 3D TV, when positioned correctly.<br/>
•    High refresh rate and consequently motion handling.<br/>
•    High contrast levels.<br/>
•    Great Smart features that rival Samsung Smart TV internet capabilities.</p>
<p>Cons<br/>
•    Lower definition of 3D images due to using passive 3D.<br/>
•    LED backlighting can cause bleeding of bright objects into the dark objects being displayed on screen.<br/>
•    Narrow margin for the vertical plane of viewing. Ie, the TV must be positioned close to being vertically square on to the viewer’s eye level. If not horizontal lines are displayed when viewing 3D.<br/>

<p>Pros<br/>
•    Full HD 3D TV<br/>
•    Excellent picture qualities, color depth and contrast.<br/>
•    Stylish design, 30mm thick, almost no bezel around the display area.<br/>
•    Unrivalled Smart internet capabilities.<br/>
•    Can interface and stream media to Samsung Galaxy SII and Tab.</p>
<p>Cons<br/>
•    Edge light bleeding is noticeable.<br/>
•    Some motion blurring and 3D crosstalk.<br/>
•    More expensive LED TV option, including active shutter 3D glasses.<br/>

<p>Pros<br/>
•    Improved NeoPlasma display is brighter and has faster response times than previous <a title="plasmas" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606125601/http://ledhdtvtelevisions.com/the-advantages-of-tv-plasmas-for-high-definition-tv-viewing-quality/">plasmas</a>.<br/>

•    Better motion handling than LED 3D TV.<br/>
•    Arguably the best 3D TV, as per industry reviews.<br/>
•    Easy calibration of <a title="Plasma TV" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606125601/http://ledhdtvtelevisions.com/tv-plasma-technology-10-popular-misconceptions-the-truth-revealed/">Plasma TV</a> compared to previous models</p>
<p>Cons<br/>
•    Most expensive option.<br/>
•    Smart TV and internet capabilities inferior to LG and Samsung models.<br/>
•    3D glasses uncomfortable and expensive.<br/>
•    Least aesthetically attractive design.</p>
<p><strong>Best 3D TV Summary</strong></p>
<p>Looking at the above 3D TV pros and cons you could say that if you were to base your decision on price alone you would go for the LG, if 3performance are your only concern then the Panasonic is your only choice, and for the best all rounder then the Samsung is the obvious choice. This is maybe over simplifying the decision of which is the best 3D TV depending upon your requirements. Despite any flaws pointed out above, all three of these 3D TVs produce absolutley stunning results.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure, if I was about to spend upwards of $2500 on a TV I would ask for a demonstration of all 3 models in my local TV showroom before handing over my cash. Take a look at the qualities of both passive 3D TV vs active 3D TV, see how the LED 3D TVs compare to the superior motion handling of the Panasonic Plasma 3D TV. And finally check out the Smart TV and internet features of the Samsung and LG and see how impressed you are by them. Only once you have done this can you decide which is your choice for the 2011 best 3D TV.</p>
