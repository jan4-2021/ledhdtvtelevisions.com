			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LED High Definition Television was designed to provide consumers with better quality and higher resolution than standard television systems. High definition television is perhaps most well known for there high quality of audio and visual, resembling the quality you would receive at a theatre. However, even if you possess a high definition television you will still need a high definition signal which can be obtained several different ways. Many people choose to pick up their high definition signal through using an antenna. Many of the recent designs in high definition televisions have this antenna built into the television. Cable companies oftentimes offer high definition television broadcasts as part of their services. You can also obtain high definition television signal and service through a satellite based television company. Examples of these companies are DirecTV and Dish Network. Components of a satellite LED television system are a standard satellite dish, high definition satellite receiver, high definition television monitor, and HDMI cable or DVI-D audio cables.</p>
<p>There are three main characteristics to an LED television broadcast system. The first of these identifiable parameters is the frame size. Frame size is referred to in pixels, like a digital camera. Frame size is referred to as how many horizontal pixels versus how many vertical pixels. You may see the formula for pixels looking like this: 1280 x 720. The second identifiable parameter is the scanning system which is defined as the letter p in italics or the letter i in italics. âPâ stands for progressive which would encompass LDTV and EDTV and displays 1,080 lines of resolution simultaneously. âIâ stands for Interlaced in which there are 1,080 lines of resolution and they are divided into pairs and encompasses SDTV. Frame rate is the third identifiable parameter for characteristics of a high definition broadcast system. Frame rate defines the number of video frames that flash by per second. High definition television requires less bandwidth than standard definition television due to the digital video compression built in.</p>
<p>A variation of high definition television is EDTV which stands for âenhanced definition televisionâ. Enhanced definition television describes the variation of a progressive version of the high definition television video format. High definition television has twice the linear resolution of any standard definition television. Since high definition television possesses twice the linear resolution this shows greater detail than any other system.</p>
<p>When looking for a high definition television to purchase you will need to know that the optimum format for a broadcast is dependent upon the video graphic recording medium that is used as well as the images characteristics. Also, the source and resolution should match the field and frame rate. Numerous companies manufacture LED high definition televisions such as Samsung, LG Electronics, Sony and Toshiba. Once you have determined which manufacturer you want to purchase an LED television from you will need to familiarize yourself with some terms and options to make your purchase simpler. There are a few different display types; LCD and LCD w/ LED. There are also different diagonal screen size options such as 40 inches to 49 inches and 50 inches or larger. Once you have decided on these choices you will need to familiarize yourself with aspect ratio and display format. You will also be able to choose which display refresh rate you want to invest in. Display refresh rates can be either 120 Hz or 240 Hz. You will of course have to choose which resolution and input you want as well. The input choices will depend upon what you will be using your LED television for. The input options are HDMI, Component video, VGA and S-Video.</p>
<p>Consumers who have switched to LED high definition television say they will never switch back to standard definition television. The advanced connectivity and picture performance as well as the eco-friendly aspects to LED high definition television are superb. Additionally, you can obtain an LED television with picture quality that has mega contrast and delivers deep, rich blacks and crisp, clean whites.</p>
<p>Overall, LED high definition television has been designed to provide the highest quality and best resolution visual and audio experience. You can grab some popcorn and sit in the comfort of your own home while enjoying all the visual and audio perks of a theatre.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As our world becomes more and more technology-oriented, introducing microchips and CPU processors into ordinary objects, it&#8217;s no surprise that the television market has evolved at such an astonishing rate. No more than ten years ago, high definition was a new, scary technology that was just beginning to blossom. Now, in the year 2009, approximately 1/4 of all U.S. households have an HDTV.</p>
<p>Each major company producing these HDTVs obviously tries to stay ahead of the innovation curve, but only some of them succeed. One of these successful innovations is from Samsung, who has deemed the technology as &#8220;LED HDTV&#8221;. What is it that separates an LED HDTV from an LCD HDTV? It&#8217;s all in the lighting used in the television set.</p>
<p>An LED, or light-emitting diode, is a relatively modern invention that has changed the way lights are used. Some of the major benefits of LEDs are that they consume less power, they produce a brighter light, and they last much longer than the standard cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) used in most HDTV sets. With a convergence of LED technology in the already booming industry of LCD (liquid crystal display) televisions, consumers will soon find that their television sets are reducing their electricity bills and minimizing their environmental footprint.</p>
<p>Because of the aforementioned benefits of an LED HDTV, Samsung (and other companies who will, undoubtedly, soon be adapting this technology) is able to provide the eco-friendly consumers a chance to help the environment. As many people are aware, using a compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) instead of the standard light bulb is an easy way to &#8220;go green&#8221;. Using an LED HDTV instead of an LCD HDTV will have the same effect: using less resources means helping out the environment. Due to this and many other innovations over at Samsung, the company is well on its way to becoming an official &#8220;green business&#8221;.</p>
<p>So next time the television breaks and a new purchase is in order, try a new LED HDTV. It not only helps you watch the latest episode of The Office &#8211; it helps the environment as well.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Plasma used to be the big thing in flat screen television, but today things have changed. Now a lot of TVs on the market are LED TVs, or as LCD TVs. LED stands for Light Emitting Diode, and LCD stands for Liquid Crystal Display. Each LED is a little mini circuit that emits light of a specific color when electricity is run through it. The TVs that are on the market that are being marketed as &#8216;LED&#8217; are actually a combination of LCD and LED technology.</p>
<p>The biggest technology with LED TVs today though is the O-LED, the Organic Light Emitting Diode. There are many companies currently experimenting with flexible screens made of O-LEDs. These flexible televisions screens have many applications such as portable computers, and smaller and lighter televisions. Also, OLEDs can allow TVs to be built into walls, or other surfaces, and also allowing for touch screen technology.</p>
<p>Currently, the company that is marketing its televisions as LED is Samsung. These TVs actually use traditional LCD screens, but instead of being backlit by a fluorescent bulb are lit from the side by LEDs. This has caused some controversy in the industry because while the TVs are being marketed as LED, they are not true LED TVs and are instead LCD TVs that have LED components.</p>
<p>However, LEDs have a very good future in television technology. LEDs use less electricity than traditional lighting and they can be made smaller and more compact. There is a distinct advantage to LEDs over LCDs. Also, the organic technology means that there will not be as many pollutants in landfills after the life of the TV is up.</p>
<p>Overall, the promise of LED TVs is a good thing to keep an eye on in the market, but currently, there are no true LED TVs currently on the market. There are development models that companies are displaying as for the future, but currently true LED TVs are not on the market at this time.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>LEDâs or light emitting diodes, are electronic components that exhibit a certain color based on a certain level of current applied to the diode. Higher current produces darker colors, and vice versa, in accordance with the light spectrum. LEDâs have been implemented in electronics for decades, and the recent developments in LED technology have brought us such luxury items as HDTV and other LED-based toys and tools.<br />
High Definition Television is a recent development in television broadcast and viewing where a digital signal is broadcast giving a higher resolution of the picture on the screen than what a standard television can. The picture tends to be clearer and more precise in definition that traditional television by being displayed on one of two major kinds of screens. One is plasma TV technology. The other is LCD (liquid crystal display) technology.<br />
LED technology comes into play more prominently in LCD TV as backlighting for those screens. The liquid crystal display screen, the same technology as a digital watch, is dark by its nature, and to be able to see a scene on a television screen, LED technology is used to brighten the screen from behind in order to make the picture visible to the viewer.<br />
The backlighting ability of LED technology was first implemented in the early 1990âs in Personal Digital Assistants and hand-held video games and cell phone screens. The technology has spread across many electronic products from MP3 players to portable DVD players.<br />
LEDâs are large by nature, and the development of a full-screen LED TV is currently under design in the industry, particularly in the pocket size TV market. Many TVs overseas that fall into the pocket TV category are sold in LCD format, and, again, are backlit by LED technology. The development of TVs that use LEDâs to form the main picture is being developed overseas, and in an experimental manner in the U.S.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many television and monitor manufacturers are now selling what they call LED TVs or LED monitors. This is somewhat of a misnomer, because these are still LCD displays. The difference between these and traditional LCD monitors is that they use a limited number of LEDs to enhance the picture created. A more appropriate way to describe these devices would be âLED-litâ LCD displays.</p>
<p>Fluorescent tubes are used to light the screen on an LCD display. The result is that they are not very accurate in displaying black. The fluorescent tubes are always on, so sometimes light can escape and bleed into areas that are meant to be dark. This results in a picture that appears less sharp than a plasma display. Additionally, fluorescent tubes have a limited range in the variety of colors they can display.</p>
<p>The picture of an LCD display can be improved by using groups of LEDs to enhance the image. There are two types of such displays: back-lit LCDs and edge-lit LCDs. Back-lit displays have LEDs placed through the entire back of the display, while edge-lit displays have LEDs lined around the entire outside of the picture.</p>
<p>An advantage to edge-lit LCDs is that they can be extremely thin because the LEDs are only around the sides of the display. They are also cheaper than back-lit LCDs because there are much fewer LEDs.</p>
<p>A down-side to back-lit LCDs is that cost prohibits controlling the LEDs one at a time. Instead, LEDs are controlled in groups of clusters. This means that when a group of LEDs on an LED monitor are turned off, it may also darken an area of the display meant to be light. On the other hand, if a group of LEDs are turned on, it may brighten an area meant to be black.</p>
<p>True LED monitors are available. These displays use one LED for every single pixel, and each one is controlled independently. They are most frequently used outdoors and are very costly. An excellent example of a true LED monitor is the television in Times Square in New York City.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For several years now the TV race has been between LCD and Plasma TVs. But the truth of the matter is that these technologies have trouble keeping up with the HD standard. Fortunately developers such as Samsung have spent the best part of a decade working on an LED screen which provides higher clarity, faster response, and lower power consumption.</p>
<p>It is this LED screen technology which has delighted consumers the world over. Walk in to any decent electronics store today, and your eyes will instantly be drawn to the new high definition LED televisions. The higher definition, and quality, radiate off these high definition LED screens. You never see any blurring or lag issues, which can occur with other formats of TV. Even with a normal movie you will instantly notice the difference between an LED screen and an LCD TV.</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits of the LED screen is quite simply it&#8217;s thickness, or should I say lack of it. LED screens are the thinnest on the market due to their unique design. Current technologies have their light source at the back. With the new High Definition LED displays the LEDs are placed along the sides of the screen, significantly reducing both the depth and power consumption of the television!</p>
<p>If you are ecologically minded then the LED televisions are a great choice for you. LED Televisions use on average 40% less power than LCD Televisions. This is nearly halving the cost of running your television, think how much that adds up to over a year, and you will be pleasantly surprised!</p>
<p>All in all, the LED Television is the perfect purchase for anyone looking to buy a new high definition television. While the LED technology is new on the market, it has been under development long enough to ensure reliability, and durability. Purchasing a High Definition LED Television will give you crystal clear viewing for years to come!</p>
